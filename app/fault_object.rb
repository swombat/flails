#This is a helper to return FaultObjects. Often times there are sitiuations with database logic that requires an "error state"
#to be set in Flash / Flex, but returning false isn't the best because it still get's mapped to the onResult handler, even returning a 
#generic object with some specific keys set, such as ({error:'someError', code:3}). That is still a pain because it gets mapped to
#the onResult function still. So return one of these objects to RubyAMF and it will auto generate a faultObject to return to flash
#so that it maps correctly to the onFault handler.
